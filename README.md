# Generating-OTP-in-Python

This Python code generates a random one-time password (OTP) of a specified length using a pool of characters. Here's a brief explanation of each part of the code:

1. **Importing the random Module:**

   - This line imports the random module, providing functions for generating pseudo-random numbers.

2. **Defining the generateOTP Function:**
  
   - This line starts the definition of a function named generateOTP that takes a parameter length.

3. **Setting the Characters String:**
   
   - This line defines a string named characters containing lowercase letters, uppercase letters, and digits. This string serves as the pool from which characters will be randomly chosen to form the OTP.

4. **Calculating the Length of the Characters String:**
   
   - This line calculates the length of the characters string, which is used to determine the range for random character selection.

5. **Generating the OTP:**
   
   - This line uses a list comprehension to generate a string (otp) by randomly selecting characters from the characters string. The random.choice() function is used for each iteration in the specified range (range(length)). The result is a string of the specified length.

6. **Returning the OTP:**
   
   - This line returns the generated OTP from the generateOTP function.

7. **Main Program:**
  
   - This line checks whether the Python script is being run as the main program.

8. **Setting the Length of OTP:**
  
   - This line declares the desired length of the OTP (in this case, 6 digits).

9. **Printing the OTP:**
   
   - This line prints the message "Your OTP is -" followed by the result of calling the generateOTP function with the specified length.

In summary, the script defines a function to generate a random OTP and prints the result in the main program. The generated OTP consists of alphanumeric characters and has a length specified by the variable length.
